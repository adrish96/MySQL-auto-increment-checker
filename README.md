# MySQL-auto-increment-checker
Simple script to scan various tables in a database, check if the tables are approaching MAX auto-increment values.
If so, send a message to Slack with the table name.  
This was the coding challenge that I received when I applied for a Platform Engineer Intern Position at [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/). I did end up clearing the round, got rejected after the Tech Interview round though :disappointed:
